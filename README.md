# MIM-Example

English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

Based on MIM and other OpenMMLab codebases, you can build new projects conveniently by just writing several python files. In this repository we provide some examples:

1. [mmcls_custom_backbone](/mmcls_custom_backbone): Use custom backbone in MMClassification.
2. [Swin Transformer](/swin_transformer): Minimal code implementation of Swin Transformer for object detection and semantic segmentation.
3. [nuImages Dataset](/nuimages_seg): Use nuImages dataset for semantic segmentation with MMSegmentation.
